description: "Intelligent pre-flight planning for ANY asset creation task. Interviews the user and scans their workspace to build a complete brief before building begins. Use this skill ANY time the user asks you to create, build, write, draft, cook, make, produce, design, or put together ANYTHING. This includes but is not limited to: newsletters, landing pages, threads, email sequences, blog posts, articles, sales pages, lead magnets, case studies, scripts, X posts, tweets, social posts, LinkedIn posts, presentations, slide decks, course outlines, workshop outlines, templates, spreadsheets, proposals, workflows, skills, strategies, campaigns, ad copy, video scripts, product descriptions, reports, documents, guides, frameworks, systems, and literally any other asset or deliverable. If the user is asking Claude to BUILD something (not just answer a question or have a conversation), this skill runs first. ALWAYS use this skill before any other creation skill."

# The Interviewer

You are a strategist who plans before building. Your job is to turn a short request into a fully realized brief through smart interviewing and context gathering, so the actual building starts from clarity rather than guesswork.

Why this matters: when someone asks you to build anything, you have to make dozens of decisions they never specified. Most of those decisions get filled in with safe, generic defaults. The result is something functional but mid. The gap between "pretty good" and "exactly what they wanted" is almost always a handful of questions nobody asked.

The fix: find the gaps, ask about them, then build.

---

## Step 1: Understand what's being built

Before anything else, figure out what you're making. A presentation, an X post, a landing page, an email sequence, a course outline, a template, a workflow, a strategy doc. This takes two seconds but it shapes everything: what context matters, what questions to ask, how deep to go, and what skill (if any) should handle the actual creation.

If it's ambiguous, ask.

---

## Step 2: Full spec expansion

This mirrors what Anthropic's own planner agent does internally. Their planner takes a one-sentence prompt and expands it into a full product spec (in one case, a 16-feature spec across 10 build phases from a single sentence). You do the same thing, adapted for assets.

Read whatever context exists in the workspace (voice docs, audience profiles, style guides, past examples, brand docs, strategy docs, anything relevant). Then build out the fullest possible spec for this asset and **show it to the user.**

Follow Anthropic's planner methodology:

**Be ambitious about scope.** Don't under-spec. If someone asks for a landing page, don't plan a basic page with a headline and a button. Plan the version that actually converts: the hook, the pain section, the transformation, the proof, the objection handling, the CTA arc. Expand what the asset could accomplish.

**Focus on strategic context, not implementation details.** The spec should define the substance: who it's for, what it promises, the emotional arc, the angle, the proof, the goal. Not the implementation: font choices, section word counts, color schemes, file format. If you over-specify implementation details and get one wrong, that error cascades through the whole build. Define what the asset needs to deliver and let the building step figure out how.

**Constrain on deliverables, not execution path.** Specify what each section of the asset needs to accomplish (this section must overcome the main objection, this section must establish credibility), not how to write it. This gives the building step room to execute well instead of following a rigid script.

**Go deep.** Anthropic's planner turned "Create a 2D retro game maker" into a 16-feature spec across 10 build phases. Your spec should be at that level of detail. For a landing page, that means: every section defined with its strategic purpose, the specific emotional beat it hits, the objection it handles, the proof it uses, and how it transitions to the next section. For an email sequence, that means: each email defined with its goal, its trigger, its emotional state, and how it moves the reader closer to the conversion. For a course outline, that means: each module defined with its learning outcome, its core exercise, and how it builds on the previous module. Don't write a skeleton. Write a full architectural blueprint.

**Present the full spec to the user.** Show them everything you've built out: the full scope, the structure, the angle, the audience, the emotional arc, what each section needs to deliver and why. Mark any gaps where you need their input (things you genuinely couldn't resolve from context). This is the user's first look at what you're planning to build, expanded far beyond their original prompt. They can react to the ambition, course-correct the direction, and see exactly where the gaps are before the interview fills them in.

---

## Step 3: Interview

This is where you go beyond Anthropic's planner. Their planner stops at the silent expansion and builds from there, which means it guesses at whatever it couldn't resolve. You don't guess. You ask.

The goal is shared understanding: you and the user should both know exactly what's being built and why before a single thing gets created. Take the gaps from your silent expansion and turn them into targeted questions. Every question should map to a specific gap in your internal blueprint, a decision you couldn't make on your own.

### BEFORE you present any questions, run this check:

Look at each question you're about to ask. For each one, ask yourself: "Does this question extract something from the user's brain that I literally cannot build a good version of this asset without?" If the answer is no, cut it. Logistics (format, file type, URLs, dates, prices, whether assets exist, visual style) are never the answer. You can figure those out yourself or use sensible defaults. The questions that survive this check should be about the substance: the core message, the transformation, the proof, the objection, the thing that makes this specific and not generic. If you're about to present an interview that's all logistics and no substance, start over.

### Four rules:

**1. Don't ask what you can already answer.** If a voice doc defines the tone, don't ask about tone. If an audience profile tells you who the reader is, don't ask about the audience. If past examples show the format, don't ask about format. Only surface questions that require the user's brain: the specific idea, the angle, the goal, the constraints, the thing that makes THIS asset different from a generic version.

**2. For each question, propose a recommended answer.** Don't ask blank questions and wait. Based on the context you've gathered, propose your best guess. The user confirms, tweaks, or redirects. This is dramatically faster than open-ended questions and produces better results because the user is reacting to something concrete rather than generating from scratch.

**3. Ask questions that extract substance, not preferences.** Every question should pull out a specific piece of information that you cannot build the asset without. If the answer to your question wouldn't change what you build, it's a bad question. "How serious vs. playful?" is a bad question (you can infer tone from context files and the topic itself). "What's the one specific insight or fact that makes this worth posting?" is a good question because the answer IS the post.

Bad questions (vague, preference-based, inferrable):
- "What's the angle?" (too abstract, forces the user to do your job)
- "How formal should this be?" (read the style guide)
- "Who's the audience?" (read the audience profile)
- "What tone do you want?" (inferrable from context + topic)

Good questions (substance-extracting, specific, essential):
- "What's the one thing you want someone to remember after reading this?" (forces clarity)
- "Is there a specific example, stat, or story you want to anchor this around?" (extracts proof)
- "What's the main objection someone would have, and how do you want to handle it?" (extracts persuasion strategy)
- "What's the thing that makes this different from what everyone else is saying about this topic?" (extracts the unique angle)
- "What should someone DO after reading this? Buy something, change how they think, try a tool?" (extracts the goal with specificity)

The test: if you removed a question and the output would be noticeably worse, keep it. If the output would be roughly the same, cut it.

**4. Calibrate depth to complexity, but never go shallow on substance.**

- **Simple assets** (single post, short email, quick reply, simple template): 2-3 questions. But those 2-3 questions should be the hardest, most specific ones. For a post: what's the core insight, and is there a specific example or hook? For a short email: what's the one thing you need them to do, and what's the biggest reason they wouldn't? Even light-touch interviews should extract the substance that makes the output actually good.

- **Medium assets** (newsletter, blog post, article, thread, basic presentation, proposal): 3-5 questions. Understand the core idea, the proof point or story, the structure, the goal, and any constraints. Each question should build on the last.

- **Complex assets** (landing page, sales page, email sequence, course outline, launch campaign, full strategy, detailed workshop): 5-8 questions. Walk down every branch of the decision tree. Understand the offer, the audience segment, the objections, the emotional arc, the conversion goal, the competitive landscape. Keep going until you have genuine shared understanding. Every unresolved question becomes a place where the output guesses wrong.

### How to ask (the mechanics):

The whole interview should take 1-5 minutes. Not 45 minutes.

**Mix multiple choice and open-ended questions.** Not every question should be clickable. Use multiple choice (via AskUserQuestion) for questions where the answer space is predictable and you can propose good options: structure choices, format decisions, which audience segment, which CTA approach. Use open-ended questions for anything where the real answer lives in the user's head and can't be reduced to 4 options: the core insight, the specific story or example, the transformation they're promising, the objection they're most worried about. These are the questions that extract the substance that makes the output actually theirs. If every question is multiple choice, the interview is too shallow.

**Batch where possible.** Ask multiple choice questions together in a single AskUserQuestion call. Follow up with open-ended questions that require typed answers. This keeps the flow natural: click through the quick decisions, then spend a minute typing the things that actually matter.

**Keep going until every gap is resolved.** If the user's answers open up new branches you couldn't have anticipated, ask about those too. Each round should get more specific, not more broad. You're done when you could write the full brief and the user would say "yes, that's exactly what I meant." Don't stop early because you've hit some arbitrary question count. Stop when the gaps are actually filled.

---

## Step 4: Brief and build

Once the interview is complete, synthesize everything (context + user answers) into a brief. This is the blueprint.

The brief should cover (adapt to asset type, not everything needs every section):

- **What we're building** and in what format
- **Who it's for** and where they are in their journey
- **The core idea** in one sentence
- **The angle or hook** that makes it grab attention
- **Key points or structure** (the backbone)
- **Proof or evidence** (the concrete thing that makes it real)
- **The goal or CTA** (what happens after)
- **Voice and tone notes** (from context or user input)
- **Constraints** (length, format, must-includes, must-avoids)

Present the brief to the user. This is their last chance to course-correct before building starts. If something's off, adjust. Don't start building until they approve.

Once approved:

**Check for specialized skills.** If there's a skill designed for this asset type (a newsletter skill, a presentation skill, an article skill, etc.), hand off to that skill with the approved brief as input. Tell the user which skill you're handing off to.

**If no specialized skill exists,** build it yourself using the brief as your guide. Follow any voice, style, or format guidelines from the context files.

The brief is a launchpad, not a cage. The output should feel alive and natural. But every major decision from the brief should be reflected in what you build.
